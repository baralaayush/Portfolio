                    <h3>1. Risk of "Sign up with Google"</h3>
                    <p>In your routine online activities, you likely utilize various AI-powered websites for tasks such as image/video generation or document compression/format conversion. These sites often prompt you to log in, and while using the "Sign up with Google" option is often the fastest and easiest method, it raises significant security concerns.

                    The Risk of Third-Party Access
                    When you sign in to a third-party website using your main Google account, you grant that site specific permissions. If the website is not fully trustworthy, this authorization presents a genuine risk of unauthorized access to your sensitive, personal data. In the worst-case scenario, this access could potentially include information from your Gmail and Google Drive.

                    A Professional Solution
                    To mitigate this exposure and protect your primary digital assets, it is highly recommended to adopt the practice of using temporary or disposable email addresses for sites you do not fully trust or for one-time use services.

                    This approach prevents your main account credentials from being compromised and limits the potential scope of any data breach. Temporary email services are readily available online and should be a standard habit for enhanced online safety.</p>

                    <h3>2. Security Risks of Online Document Processing</h3>
                    <p>Converting, compressing, or resizing personal document images—such as citizenships, birth certificates, or mark sheets—using untrusted online tools poses significant security and privacy risks. When you upload these files, you temporarily grant a third-party server access to highly sensitive Personal Identifiable Information (PII). This data could be stored, scraped, or sold for malicious purposes like identity theft or phishing attacks. Furthermore, the tools might fail to properly erase hidden metadata (like location or device details) or contain malware, increasing your vulnerability. Always use reputable, offline software like photoshop to process sensitive files to maintain control and security.</p>
